# Combining Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning and Game theory approaches in building a poker bot

This is the project repository for the the deep Reinforcement Learning class (WS20/21) at the university of OsnabrÃ¼ck by Mathis Pink and Janosch Bajorath.

## Dependencies
clubs, clubs_gym, environment.yml, requirements.txt

## The Code
We have 2 python scripts and 2 jupyter notbooks that are intended for end user application:
1. main.py
> The core deep CFR algorithm implemented according to (DEEP CFR REF). Set preferred parameters within the script (preset ones are standart ones used by us) and run it from your terminal. It will save both players trained advantage models uring each CFR iteration

2. test_poker_bot.ipynb
> Bla

3. play_against_bot.ipynb
> Bla

4. eval_bot.py
> Bla

Oother scripts:
1. deep_CFR_algorithm
2. deep_CFR_model
3. poker_agent
4. utils
5. memory_utils
6. training_utils
7. jupyter_nb_utils
8. eval_utils

Folders:
1. trained_models
2. results/eval
